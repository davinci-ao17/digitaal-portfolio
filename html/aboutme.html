		<h2>The life of: Brandon van Zanten</h2>
		<main class="main-overmij">
			<p>First of all I'm going to introduce myself, My name is Brandon Devon van Zanten and I'm born on the 9th of March 2001 in a hospital in Dordrecht. My parents lived in Dordrecht too then, so I'm born and raised in Dordrecht. My dad worked in Fijnaart and my mom didn't have work that time.
			<br><br>
			After 6 years of living<img class="jacobcat" src="../img/jacobcat.jpg"> in the Jacob Catstraat it was time to move to a more suiting location it's there where I lived for the most of my childhood. At that time I did go to the Prinses Julianaschool in Dordrecht, so basically not much changed. Everything was going very well I loved going to school and I had many friends. In fifth grade it didn't go that very well anymore, because my parents got divorced, At the start of the divorce I really had a hard time. In sixth grade I did the CITO test and scored below average and was really sad about that. The decision was made that VMBO-Basis was best for me.
			<br><br>
			At my middleschool period I went to LOKET (before it was LOC@). I got placed in seventh grade with a really good friend from primary school. I got placed in "Klas 1F" of LOKET Walburg College. I did my best to get good grades, without much effort, because I got really high grades without learning. I decided to remain at the same school on the same level and go on to eight grade. At the end of eight grade I got the best grades of the class. I got for all school subjects an eight or higher. My coach told me that I was allowed to go to MAVO, but I refused. In eight grade everyone did LOB that means job orienting lessons, because in ninth grade you must choose a profession. I arrived at electrical engineering and thought this is it. I told my coach that I wanted to stay at LOKET and learn electrical engineering at VMBO-Kader level. That suggestion was accepted and I moved on to electrical engineering VMBO-Kader.
			<br><br>
			I was still at the same location, but instead of Walburg College,<img class="elektro" src="../img/elektro.jpg"> I got placed on Develstein College in "klas 3E" (ninth grade). I've learned very much about electrical engineering and really liked it and thought I want to do this later as my job. I finished ninth grade very easly.
			<br><br>
			In tenth grade or klas 4E it got a little bit harder. I wanted to quit electrical engineering after autumn break, because I lost interest in electrical engineering and wanted to do something else. I got my certificate and finished my exams with only 1 insufficient grade.
			<br><br>
			Now I am at DaVinci College in Dordrecht and I'm a Dutch first year student of Application/Media Development.</p>
